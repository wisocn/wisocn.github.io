Hello world and welcome to my first post

## New Beginning

This is a new beginning on my blog on hugo and this seems pretty cool so im adding random text here because I dont know **what** to add here. So im adding a lot more random text here.

This is another test.

## Code

This is python code:


from random import randint
from faker import Fake
randint(1, 2)

destFile = "largedataset-" + timestart + ".txt"
file_object = open(destFile,"a")
file_object.write("uuid" + "," + "username" + "," + "name" + "," + "country" + "\n")

def create_names(fake):
    for x in range(numberRuns):
        genUname = fake.slug()
        genName =  fake.first_name()
        genCountry = fake.country()
file_object.write(genUname + "," + genName + "," + genCountry + "\n")
..


This is bash code:


#!/usr/bin/env bash
var="ruan"
echo "Hello, ${var}"
